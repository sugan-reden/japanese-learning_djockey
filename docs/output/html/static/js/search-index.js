For a mobile version, please look at AnkiWeb.\n\nQuick Translation\n\nGoogle Translate ❌\n\nPlease try to avoid Google Translate. Most of the time, the translations are inaccurate and end up beingmisleading for one who is learning a language. Particularly because, in my experience, it seems to oftenliteral translations with very little acknowledgement of context.:::\n\nDeepL ✅ - Generally a far better option than Google Translate, but still try to limit your quicktranslations to a minimum. In any case, the more you learn, the more the need to lean on this tool willprobably diminish.\n\nCommunities and Mentalities\n\nRefold\n\nAJATT\n\nThe Moe Way\n\n","url":"file:///C:/Users/reden/dev/japanese-learning_djockey/docs/output/html/resource-center/resource-list-old.html"}]
